      I'm not good at goodbyes
      I miss the sunshine in your eyes
      Who said cowboys don't cry?
      Come on, baby, let's take one last ride

      We're riding 'round this carousel if you catch my drift
      We're riding 'round this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
      We're riding 'round this carousel, getting dizzy 'til we're sick
      Love is like a circle, there's no easy way to end
      
      It's too much, I can't take anymore
      Stuck feeling like we've been here before
      But now the sun stopped shining here in the Wild West
      My heart stopped beating, and it's sunk into my chest
      
      We're riding 'round this carousel if you catch my drift
      We're riding 'round this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
      We're riding 'round this carousel, getting dizzy 'til we're sick
      Love is like a circle, there's no easy way to end
      
      Just an outlaw who only had one friend
      I wonder if I'll ever see her face again
      Dark clouds hanging over, they follow where I've been
      My cowboy tears are still blowing in the wind
      
      We're riding 'round this carousel if you catch my drift
      We're riding 'round this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
      We're riding 'round this carousel, getting dizzy 'til we're sick
      Love is like a circle, there's no easy way to end
      
      I'm not good at goodbyes
      I miss the sunshine in your eyes
      Who said cowboys don't cry?
      Come on, baby, let's take one last ride
      
      We're riding 'round this carousel if you catch my drift
      We're riding 'round this wagon wheel, she took me for a spin
      We're riding 'round this carousel, getting dizzy 'til we're sick
      Love is like a circle, there's no easy way to end
